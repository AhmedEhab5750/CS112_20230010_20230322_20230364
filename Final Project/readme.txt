You will need to download Qt creator to build the program, after downloading it you will need to open the project using Qt creator,
then you go to the main project directory and right click on it, choose add existing files then you select all image libraries 
and now you are just 1 step away from using the best photoshop ever just click build from the green button down in the left of the screen.
